# Yeezus

This personal project was built as a simple application for a user as a homescreen when they open their browser. It mimics the Google Chrome Momentum plugin. When a user reaches the application it displays a random quote by the great philosopher Kanye West from the [Kanye Rest Api](https://kanye.rest/). Additionally it displays the date and time,the current weather in Denver using the [Darksky Api](https://darksky.net/dev), and a random image from [Unsplash Api](https://unsplash.com/developers).

## Goals
